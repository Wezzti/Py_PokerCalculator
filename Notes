Each player is given two cards directly and not one each two times

In find_winner, only if there is one winner does it work

In player.scores:
	Best hand is a list of cards
	Score is an integer
	Highest Rank is an integer
	Kickers is a list



Working on Kickers:
	Kickers are the cards in my hand that is not part of the combo? How do I program this? I don't know what was in the combo.
